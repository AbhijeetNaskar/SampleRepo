With features such as versioning, co-authoring, and document workflows, teams can collaborate effectively on documents while ensuring data integrity and compliance.

What Site Owners Can Do:

Site Customization: Site owners have the ability to customize SharePoint sites to meet the specific needs of their teams or projects. This includes customizing site navigation, adding web parts, and configuring site permissions to control access to content.

Content Management: Site owners can manage content within their sites, including uploading documents, creating lists, and organizing content in libraries. They can also set document-level permissions and establish content approval workflows to ensure compliance and data security.

User Management: Site owners have administrative control over user access and permissions within their sites. They can add or remove users, assign permission levels, and manage user groups to control who can view, edit, or contribute to site content.

Site Administration: Site owners are responsible for site administration tasks such as site settings configuration, site maintenance, and monitoring site usage and performance. They can also manage site features and activate/deactivate site templates as needed.

What Site Owners Cannot Do:

Global Configuration: Site owners do not have access to global SharePoint settings or configuration options that affect the entire SharePoint environment. These settings are typically managed by SharePoint administrators at the site collection or farm level.

Server Administration: Site owners do not have administrative access to the SharePoint server infrastructure or underlying server settings. Tasks such as server maintenance, backups, and performance tuning are typically handled by SharePoint administrators or IT professionals.

Platform Customization: While site owners can customize individual sites, they do not have the ability to customize the underlying SharePoint platform or modify core functionality. Customizations at the platform level require advanced development skills and may require involvement from SharePoint developers or administrators.

In conclusion, SharePoint 2019 offers a comprehensive set of features and capabilities to empower business users to collaborate effectively, manage content efficiently, and drive productivity within their organizations. With its intuitive interface and powerful collaboration tools, SharePoint 2019 is an invaluable platform for businesses seeking to streamline communication, improve knowledge sharing, and achieve their business goals.
